The Geological Layer Stratification Merging Tool  (Stratmerge) is a software tool for the computation of simplified geological representations of an subsurface region of interest by using weighting functions and computing equivalent hydrogeological properties. Stratmerge is implemented in Python 3.9, it is object oriented with an focus stratified geological layers which have to be provided as Geo-ASCII files all having the same resolution, the same coordinates and the same number of grid columns and rows. Stratmerge provides functionality to merge individual layers, to generate a planar 2d geological model of representative equivalent values as well as to extrude the geological stratification to a 3D VTK mesh. Stratmerge is developed by the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources [BGR].
